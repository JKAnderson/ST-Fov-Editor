# ST Fov Editor
A utility to easily edit the field of view and HUD FoV of Stalker games.  
Supports:  
+ Shadow of Chernobyl 1.0004  
+ Shadow of Chernobyl 1.0005  
+ Shadow of Chernobyl 1.0006  
+ Clear Sky 1.5.10  
+ Call of Pripyat 1.6.02  
  
Does not support:  
+ Mods that modify bin\xrGame.dll, bin\XR_3DA.exe, or bin\xrEngine.exe (unless they're also just switching FoV; doesn't hurt to try)

# Usage
1. Select the bin folder in your game install
2. Select your game version  
	Note: as long as the base version is correct, modifying FoV should work regardless  
	Unfortunately, modifying HUD FoV is different not only for each game version, but also each language and distribution service  
	So if the exact source of your copy isn't listed, HUD FoV may not be supported
3. Click Scan to check the current value
4. Enter your desired value
5. Click Patch to edit the value and automatically make a backup
